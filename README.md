Let's break down this JavaScript code step by step:

### Step 1: Get the Current Path

```javascript
const currentPath = location.pathname;
```

- `location` is a built-in JavaScript object that contains information about the current URL.
- `location.pathname` gives you the path part of the URL, which is the part that comes after the domain name (e.g., in `http://example.com/about`, the pathname is `/about`).
- `currentPath` is a constant variable that stores this pathname.

### Step 2: Select All Navigation Links

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('nav a').forEach(link => {
```

- `document.querySelectorAll('nav a')` selects all `<a>` (anchor) elements inside a `<nav>` element in the HTML document.
- This method returns a list of all matching elements.
- `.forEach(link => { ... })` loops through each of these `<a>` elements, and `link` represents the current element in each iteration of the loop.

### Step 3: Check and Update Class for Each Link

```javascript
    if (link.href.indexOf(currentPath) !== -1) {
        link.classList.add('active');
    }
    else {
        link.classList.remove('active');
    }
});
```

- `link.href` is the full URL that the `<a>` element points to (e.g., `http://example.com/about`).
- `link.href.indexOf(currentPath)` checks if the `currentPath` is part of the `href` URL. 
  - `indexOf(currentPath)` returns the position of `currentPath` within `href` if it exists, otherwise it returns `-1`.
  - If `indexOf(currentPath) !== -1`, it means `currentPath` is found somewhere in the `href` URL.
- If `currentPath` is found in the `href`, `link.classList.add('active')` adds the CSS class `active` to that link.
- If `currentPath` is not found in the `href`, `link.classList.remove('active')` removes the CSS class `active` from that link (if it had it).

### What Does This Code Do?

In summary, this code snippet is used to highlight the current page link in a navigation menu. 

- It first gets the path of the current URL.
- It then selects all links in the navigation bar.
- For each link, it checks if the link's URL contains the current path.
  - If it does, it adds the `active` class to that link (which can be styled with CSS to look highlighted).
  - If it doesn't, it removes the `active` class from that link.

This way, when you visit a page, the corresponding link in the navigation bar will be visually highlighted, indicating to the user which page they are currently on.
